How to detect obstacles?
Hector mapping with FOS


Any kind of faducials (landmarks) are always good. We need to deliver from one room to another. As long as you can arbistrality from a to be to b to c. Haruka markers would be fine. Having a static map loaded in the memory, and having a hector mapping to place you in the map.  
You could put Harukas in the ceiling.


Will we need to test in a hostpial facility?  
No, but in a simulation of. Perhaps ERB 208.

What would demonstrate the complete functionality?  
Showcasing that the robot can move arbitrarily between multiple rooms in ERB second floor.  

QR Code  
You can position yourself relative to that QR code.  
NFC tags and RF tags won't work like that.  
Haruka tags are even better. They are designed specifically for position recognition.  
You can print the Haruko tags off of a piece of paper.  
aruco tags lol
