How to detect obstacles?
Hector mapping with FOS


Any kind of faducials (landmarks) are always good. We need to deliver from one room to another. As long as you can arbistrality from a to be to b to c. Haruka markers would be fine. Having a static map loaded in the memory, and having a hector mapping to place you in the map.  
You could put Harukas in the ceiling.


Will we need to test in a hostpial facility?  
No, but in a simulation of. Perhaps ERB 208.
